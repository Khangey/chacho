title: Two letters on justice and open debate
---
Earlier this month, two open letters appeared sequentially on different
websites, but unfortunately buried very quickly on my social media
timelines. The reason being, first, I don't follow any celebrity,
second, so many things are going at the same time, especially in this
year.  
  
However, may I point you once again at the letters as well as an
overview from a third party, since as a broken coloured transgender I am
not in a position to make an impartial judgement:

Magazine](https://harpers.org/a-letter-on-justice-and-open-debate/)
