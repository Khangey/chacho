Well, I certainly remember my life before the Internet everywhere. I
remember having to look up a hug bus route table book every weekend
morning, and my frist phone was a dumb phone when I was 14, because my
parents were very sick of not being able to contact me when I was out
doing stuff alone.  
  
Also: I am eight years younger [than Federico](https://thesweetsetup.com/sweet-ipad-setup-federico-viticci/).  
  
Recently I have been thinking about this a lot. Many Chinese of the same
age as me are in a very strange position as of digital generation. We
were able to pick up computers and Internet at a very young age, but
still had to mostly rely on analog stuff up until very recent. I have
been using Mac for several years now, but my mum still asks me for
Windows tech support, since she does not want to spend the time to adapt
to macOS after more than twenty years.  
When I had a dumb phone, I was on GSM or EDGE all the time, and used SMS
to post to Weibo, typed on T9 keyboard.  
When I had my first Blackberry, for the first time I had mobile Internet
connection, and read long format articles every morning on its beautiful
huge screen (not anymore on today's standards).  
When I had my first iPad (mini gen 1), I used it to took photos and post
them to Instagram, because I post my good photos taken by a DSLR to
Flickr. Now I post all photos to Instagram, and my Flickr account is
just another IFTTT ghost.  
  
I remember using Google China and Yahoo China. I remember installing
Maxthon on a super slow Win 2000 computer. I remember longing for
bluetooth earphones that I could listen to music on without hurting my
ears. But, oh my, they do feel like a previous life.
