瓜总寄了明信片给我，我也想寄给她，但总担心寄出去之后她就搬家了然后收不到
ry，于是就这样吧。

Danny sent a postcard to me, and I want to send something back. But my
big worry is always that she might move away right after I send it, so,
this is it.

瓜总：  
虽然你说感觉我的生活还不错，我自己也依然享受作为学生的日常，但研究生真的苦。我有点儿想不起来以前怎么一个学期能学十门课，怎么考前几个星期才开始复习还能考得挺好，怎么在课余还能干点其他事儿。  
然而如果让我再选一次应该还是会考研，就像我觉得让你再选一次你也还是会直接工作。怎么说呢，我是个爱钻牛角尖的人，而你更擅长做实事。  
希望你喜欢你的工作。我喜欢我的专业，但日渐感觉到我的热情不完全放在它身上。可能这也是成为大人的体验的一部分，毕竟，似乎，大部分人都不会从事自己真正热爱的事业？如果你还打算着下一个目的地的话，那很好，但可能我们不会在欧洲再见，因为，厄，我终究还是想去美国看看。  
加油8。

Danny:  
Although you wrote that my life seemed good, and I, too, enjoy the daily
life of still being a student, but postgraduate life sucks. I can't
remember how we used to take ten lectures in a semester. How did I start
reviewing just a few weeks before the exams and still get fine grades?
How did I find spare time to do other things?  
However, if I were to choose again, I might still take it. I think that
if you were to choose again, you would also choose to work again. I am a
person who splits hairs, and you are better at getting things done.  
I hope you like your work. I like my major, but I feel that my
enthusiasm is not completely on it. Maybe this is also part of the
experience of becoming a grown-up. After all, it seems that most people
do not follow a career that they really love. If you are still planning
for the next destination, that's great, but maybe we won't meet again in
Europe, because, well, I want to check out the United States after
all.  
Good luck lah.
