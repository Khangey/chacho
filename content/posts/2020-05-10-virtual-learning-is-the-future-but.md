title: Virtual learning is the future, but maybe not in the form that you are experiencing

Disclaimer: the future (normative, not descriptive)  
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

  
So you are a student like me, "attending school" through Zoom these days
like me. If you were also socially awkward like me, you may find this
version of education more enjoyable, just like me.  
  
I firmly believe in learning through digital methods, not only since it
can be more inclusive, but also, digital records tend to be lighter in
weight, more searchable, and more editable than their analogue
counterparts.  
For example, back in the days when we physically attended school, the
contrast of backpack sizes between students from my department vs.
students from the law school is astonishing. Each of them constantly
carried huge binders, hundreds of index cards, thicc law books, etc.
Every time I saw a law student with their bag, I could not help shrinking
a little bit inside, and thought how much better would their life be if
all those paper were digitised.  
Several years ago, I were one of those who carried binders in their arm.
What pushed me over the line was when moving out of dorm at my sophomore
year, the amount of paper notes and textbooks was devastating. Later
that year in my new apartment, I spent the whole summer break scanning
every single page, and never created another page of notes.  
  
But virtual learning is more than video chats with the professor and the
class.  
In fact, the whole "learn with a class" concept does not appeal to me.
While children may need a crowd of companions for forming of social
skills, that is not needed as much in learning. Everyone has their own
pace, interest and level of acceptance when learning new things, and an
arbitrarily imposed ["one pace for all" is a pace that suits
none](https://www.thestar.com/news/insight/2016/01/16/when-us-air-force-discovered-the-flaw-of-averages.html "Todd Rose on the absence of perfect average").  
We all remember the excitement of discovering [Khan
Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), one of the most meaningful
implication of which is we can provide <u>**uniform contents**</u> that
are required by the curriculum at a <u>**dynamic pace**</u>, letting
each student to adapt their progress in a personal and changeable way,
thus make education really for everyone.  
  
This topic also reminds me of [Vulcan Learning
Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&v=KvMxLpce3Xw "YouTube video of a Vulcan School in Star Trek (2009)")
from *Star Trek*, where the whole "class" learns in one room, but each
and every student learns in their own dome with separate screens,
naked-eye augmented reality, and audio equipment, so that they can
choose the pace and contents that suit themselves the most.  
Notice how the contents are pre-recorded (here taught by the computer,
but can be videos like in Khan Academy), while there are several
teachers walking around. This design provides several edges besides
decreased need of human resource. First, it prevents the human error
that comes with different teachers teaching different classes, because
every teacher has their own style, advantages and disadvantages, so that
every class ends up with slightly different results even if they fully
absorbed what their teacher has taught. Second, the curriculum and the
contents can be easily monitored and modified all the time, keeping them
always up-to-date, instead of once every couple of years, or even
decades. Finally, the present teachers can provide flexible and
real-time help that computers may not yet be capable of.  
Also, I can easily imagine that if any student has disabilities that
prevent them from fully utilising the system, their dome can be easily
modified in a way that suits them, without having to consider whether it
affects everyone else. More inclusiveness — this should be the prime
focus of our education system going into the new decade.  
  
If anyone were to create a new form of education, I think this is it.
This is the personalised (therefore inclusive) and future-proof form of
education that we as a society should work towards. This is the way of
education I wish I were educated, I want my future kids to be educated,
and, I hope, can push the human culture to the next level.
